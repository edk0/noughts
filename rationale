noughts
=======

This is a relatively simple program that plays Noughts & Crosses / Tic Tac Toe.
The algorithm in use is a very simple implementation of pure minimax (with no
heuristic function). As a result, it will never lose a game, or miss a
guaranteed win, but it won't necessarily choose the best moves for sneaking by a
human opponent.

Some care is taken to avoid costly tree walks for multiple moves when they are
equivalent by mirror or rotational symmetry.

It would be much faster on turns 1 and 2 with an opening book, but that seems
boring and a little bit like cheating.
