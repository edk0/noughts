noughts and cross / tic tac toe

The Plan:
- trivial web server
  build in state for two-player?
- program that plays one move of tic-tac-toe
  - minimax should do?
  - tic tac toe has a lot of symmetry: e.g. with an x in the centre there are
    just two unique next moves. with an empty board there are just three.
